# Our Leader!

Hi there, I am Kevin Luke and it is amazing if you have ventured here to know more about my Science-AI Symbiotic Group. 

I am the principal investigator/leader at the group. I have formed this group by keeping research in mind. I did my BSc (Physics)(2019) and MSc (Astrophysics)(2021) from St. Xavier's College, Autonomous, Mumbai. I am honored and humbled to have completed my undergraduate and graduate studies at this highest ranked institution in India. In my studies at St. Xaviers I was pushed beyond the box to make innovations by working/studying with the best minds in the field of Astrophysics. Due to this I secured a position as a MSc thesis student work with renowed CIFR Azrieli fellowship scientist and professor Dr. Shriharsh Tendulkar at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research at Navy Nagar, Colaba. 

Working for thesis there I developed a new cutting edge machine learning technology for CHIME/FRB telescope located at BC, Canada. I am a member of the CHIME/FRB Collaboration. After MSc I took up position as a project student at Dr. Tendulkar's TIFR-NCRA Transients Lab where I am currently working as my second job. At TIFR-NCRA Transients Lab I am currently working to developing a new software/hardware backend for CHIME/FRB telescope called as CHIME/Slow which will one of the most powerful backends to discover very high energy explosions called as Fast Radio Burst/FRBs originating from neutron stars, magnetars and black holes from billions of light years away. I also manage daily operations of the CHIME/FRB telescope to ensure smooth collection of data and troubleshooting of problems encountered at the telescope's hardware/software interface.

It is my great fortune to work additionally at Seven Square Academy where I got in touch with one of the amazing students ever. Hence I have taken a task that I, myself, will do my best to inculcate knowledge and research aptitude in my students working at Science-AI Symbiotic Group.

Apart from education and research I learn German, have completed official Goethe A1, A2 exams recognised by German Government and I code extensively towards ML, AI and their integration in astronomy.
