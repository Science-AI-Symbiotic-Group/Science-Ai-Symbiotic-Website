# The Science-AI Symbiotic Group

The Science-AI Symbiotic Group is an initiative by Kevin Luke, science teacher at [Seven Square Academy Naigaon (SSAN)](https://naigaon.sevensquareacademy.org/) where students are guided to perform multiple projects that include the usage of Science and Ai/Computer Science hence the name "Science Ai Symbiotic". 

It was envisioned by the Principal of the school Mrs. Deepinder Kaur Chadda to revolutionise education by introducing students to research early on. Then the idea was brought to fruit by Kevin Luke who already is into cutting edge research at TIFR, Mumbai.

In this group there exists no hierarchy, there is no command structure. Everyone including the leader, Kevin Luke, work as a collective and egalitarian values are nurtured. Due to this it has been observed there is free flow of thinking and innovation and members are motivated rather than forced to think innovatively.
