# The Science Ai Symbiotic Group

The Science Ai Symbiotic Group is an initiative by Kevin Luke, science teacher at [Seven Square Academy Naigaon (SSAN)](https://naigaon.sevensquareacademy.org/) where students perform multiple projects that include the usage of Science and Ai/Computer Science hence the name "Science Ai Symbiotic". The members of each project are different but they all are guided by Kevin Luke.

It was envisioned by the Prinicpal of the school Mrs. Deepinder Kaur Chadda to revolutionise education by introducing students to research early on. Then the idea was brought to fruit by Kevin Luke who already is into cutting edge research at TIFR, Mumbai.

Science education, particularly STEM, can be made more interesting if  students are involved in the frontiers of project development and research. This is made possible in this group where students are pushed beyond the box to think and innovate. This innovation is the only way to alleviate the problems in the society because by innovations we will get better thinkers, engineers, scientists who in turn can give back to the society.
