# Wind Turbine Farm Model

Young engineers at our group designed a model wind turbine farm to highlight the importance of sustainable energy education at school level.

## Introduction

In a world facing the challenges of climate change and a growing demand for clean, renewable energy sources, the need for sustainable energy solutions has never been more critical. In response to this demand, I embarked on a project to create a model wind turbine farm, a tangible representation of the potential of wind energy to power the future.

## Planning and Design

For the design, we chose a scale model approach, ensuring that the turbines, landscape, and surroundings were accurately represented. Each wind turbine was handcrafted to resemble its full-scale counterparts, capturing the essence of these majestic structures.

## Educational Component

The model wind turbine farm served not only as an artistic endeavor but also as an educational tool. It was an opportunity to inform the public, especially young minds, about the benefits of wind energy and its role in mitigating climate change.
