Our team of dedicated students is proud to present our pioneering project, an AI-driven leaf disease detection system developed using Python and Keras. We have harnessed the power of artificial intelligence to transform the future of farming, ensuring healthier crops and increased agricultural sustainability.

## The Challenge

The global agricultural landscape is fraught with challenges, and one of the most significant threats to crop health is the prevalence of plant diseases. Early detection is crucial to minimize losses and reduce the environmental impact of aggressive chemical treatments.

## Our Solution

Our team recognized the need for an accessible and cost-effective solution to combat plant diseases and ensure the overall health of crops. Using Python, Keras, OpenCV we've developed a suit of computer vision and ai tools that are both user-friendly and highly efficient.
