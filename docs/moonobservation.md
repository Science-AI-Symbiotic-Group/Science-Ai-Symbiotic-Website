# Watch the Moon, Learn the Moon Project

We all watch moon daily high up in the skies wandering through the space. But did we ever think how beautiful and complex the surface of the moon is?

Well, at our group we aim to answer these questions.

## Abstract  
The Lunar Research Project for 8th, 9th, 10th-grade students is a comprehensive educational initiative designed to immerse students in lunar research, fostering scientific inquiry and promoting STEM education. Students will collaborate, apply critical thinking skills, and utilize data from NASA and JAXA, including topographical data, terrain height, terrain slope, regolith temperature, and iron oxide abundances. By involving students in authentic lunar research, this project aims to deepen their understanding of lunar geology, inspire an interest in space science,and develop their data analysis and communication skills.


## Methodology
The Lunar Research Project for  students will be conducted through a structured process:

### 1. Lunar Observation Journal: 
The project begins with students individually observing the Moon on different dates, maintaining lunar observation journals with telescope. This phase promotes independent scientific inquiry and systematic data collection.

### 2. Research Assignment:
2.1 Selection of Lunar Areas: Each student will be assigned a specific lunar area for further investigation. These areas are carefully selected to encompass a range of geological features,including craters, maria, highlands, and other notable formations.
2.2 Data Collection and Tools: Students will utilize data from NASA and JAXA, including:
A) Topography Features: Utilizing topographical data, students will examine the Moon's surface, identifying mountains, valleys, and plains.
B) Terrain Height: Analysis of terrain height data will provide insights into the variations across the lunar terrain.
C) Terrain Slope:The project aims to determine the steepness and gradients of the lunar surface using slope data.
D) Regolith Temperature: Data analysis will reveal temperature variations across the lunar surface.
E) Iron Oxide Abundances (FeO): Students will investigate the presence and distribution of iron oxide on the Moon, relating it to geological processes and lunar formation theories.

### 3. Data Analysis and Collaboration: 
In the data analysis phase, students work collaboratively,draw conclusions and fill in a data analysis report. Regular meetings and discussions promote
teamwork and communication skills. The lunar observation journal will be compiled with individual data analysis reports into a comprehensive report
