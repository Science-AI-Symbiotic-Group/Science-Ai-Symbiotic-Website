# Watch the Moon, Learn the Moon Project

We all watch moon daily high up in the skies wandering through the space. But did we ever think how beautiful and complex the surface of the moon is? Well, at our group we aim to answer this question.

## Abstract  
Students collaborate, apply critical thinking skills, and utilize data from NASA and JAXA, including topographical data, terrain height, terrain slope, regolith temperature, and iron oxide abundances.

## Methodology
The Lunar Research Project for  students will be conducted through a structured process:

### 1. Lunar Observation Journal: 
The project begins with students individually observing the Moon on different dates, maintaining lunar observation journals with telescope. This phase promotes independent scientific inquiry and systematic data collection.

### 2. Research Assignment:
2.1 Selection of Lunar Areas: Each student will be assigned a specific lunar area for further investigation. These areas are carefully selected to encompass a range of geological features,including craters, maria, highlands, and other notable formations.
2.2 Data Collection and Tools: Students will utilize data from NASA and JAXA, including:
A) Topography Features: Utilizing topographical data, students will examine the Moon's surface, identifying mountains, valleys, and plains.
B) Terrain Height: Analysis of terrain height data will provide insights into the variations across the lunar terrain.
C) Terrain Slope:The project aims to determine the steepness and gradients of the lunar surface using slope data.
D) Regolith Temperature: Data analysis will reveal temperature variations across the lunar surface.
E) Iron Oxide Abundances (FeO): Students will investigate the presence and distribution of iron oxide on the Moon, relating it to geological processes and lunar formation theories.

### 3. Data Analysis and Collaboration: 
In the data analysis phase, students work collaboratively,draw conclusions and fill in a data analysis report. Regular meetings and discussions promote teamwork and communication skills. The lunar observation journal will be compiled with individual data analysis reports into a comprehensive report.



## Photos
Students of the group have captured a lot of moon, saturn, jupiter photos from a 6 inch Newtonian reflector telescope.

## Preprint on NASA ADS
Our preprint has appeared on Cornell University's Arxiv and NASA ADS library which details the overview of the project. 

The paper is available at NASA ADS: [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240201856L/abstract](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240201856L/abstract)

## Podcasts
Students took part in podcasts regarding various aspects of the project to share what they feel about astronomy, lunar geology, space exploration. This gives a glimpse on how young students view the world. The youtube channel is here [https://www.youtube.com/@science-ai-symbiotic-group](https://www.youtube.com/@science-ai-symbiotic-group)
